# skin-cancer-ResNet50
This notebook demonstrates the use of a deep learning model (ResNet50) for detecting skin cancer from dermoscopic images. Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project focuses on building an automated system to classify images as either benign or malignant.
